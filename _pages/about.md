## About Me
Hi! I am a PhD student at the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy. My fields are labor economics and applied microeconomics. My research focuses on crime and the criminal justice system.

Prior to graduate school, I was a research assistant at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors in Washington, D.C. and I completed by undergraduate degree in economics with a math emphasis at the Univeristy of Wisconsin - Madison (Go Badgers!).
