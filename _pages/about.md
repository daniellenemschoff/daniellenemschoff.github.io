Hi! I am a PhD candidate at the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy. My fields are labor economics and applied microeconomics. My research focuses on the criminal justice system. Across policing, sentencing, and incarceration, I examine how broader social factors, such as family dynamics and mental health, interact with crime and the justice system.

<strong>I am on the 2025-26 job market.</strong> 

Prior to graduate school, I was a research assistant at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors in Washington, D.C. and I completed by undergraduate degree in economics with a math emphasis at the University of Wisconsin - Madison.
