Hi! I am a PhD candidate at the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy. My fields are labor economics and applied microeconomics. My research focuses on the economics of crime and the criminal justice system. 

<strong>I am on the 2025-26 job market.</strong> 

Prior to graduate school, I was a research assistant at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors in Washington, D.C. and I completed by undergraduate degree in economics with a math emphasis at the University of Wisconsin - Madison.
